\section{Entry Point, External Libraries, Scoping and Namespace}
\subsection{\texttt{main} function}
When a compiled Extend program is executed, the \texttt{main} function is evaluated. All computations necessary to calculate the return value of the function are performed, after which the program terminates. The \texttt{main} function must be a function of a single argument, conventionally denoted args, which is guaranteed to be a 1-by-n range containing the command line arguments.
\subsection{Scoping and Namespace}
There is a single namespace for functions and global variables that is shared between all files composing an Extend program. As a result, multiple definitions of functions with the same name, whether in the same file or not, will cause a compile-time error. However, functions may declare local variables sharing a name with a global variable; the local variable defintion will override the global variable within that function. Function definitions may not be nested. If an outer function passes a variable into an inner function call, lazy evaluation may mean that the inner function indirectly has access to variables defined in the outer function call; however,
