\section{Entry Point}
\subsection{\texttt{main} function}
When a compiled Extend program is executed, the \texttt{main} function is evaluated. All computations necessary to calculate the return value of the function are performed, after which the program terminates. If the function declaration includes parameters, the first argument will be a 1-by-n range containing the command line arguments. Any other parameters, if declared, will evaluate to \texttt{empty}.
