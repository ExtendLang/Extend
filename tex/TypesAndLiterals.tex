\section{Types and Literals}
		Extend has three primitive data types, \textbf{Number}, \textbf{String}, and \textbf{Empty}, and one composite type, \textbf{Range}.
	\subsection{Primitive Data Types}
		A \textbf{Number} is an immutable primitive value corresponding to a double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754 value. Numbers can be written in an Extend source file as either integer or floating point constants; both are represented internally as floating-point values. There is no separate type representing an integer.

		A \textbf{String} is a immutable primitive value that is internally represented a C-style null-terminated byte array corresponding to ASCII values. A String can be written in an Extend source file as a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes, with the usual escaping conventions. Extend does not allow for slicing of strings to access specific characters; access to the contents of a string will only be available through standard library functions.

		The \textbf{Empty} type can be written as the keyword \texttt{empty}, and serves a similar function to \texttt{NULL} in SQL; it represents the absence of a value.

	\subsection{Ranges}
		Extend has one composite type, \textbf{Range}. A range is a subset of the cells of a variable, as described in section~\ref{sec:vardecl}. Ranges can be nested arbitrarily deeply and can be used to represent (immutable) lists, matrices, or more complicated data structures. For convenience, the range literal syntax can be used to implicitly declare an anonymous variable and assign the range to the entire contents of this variable.
\subsubsection{Range Literals}
		A range literal is a semicolon-delimited list of rows, enclosed in curly brackets. Each row is a comma-delimited list of numbers, strings, or range literals. A few examples follow:
